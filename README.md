### Repository for my Bachelor's Thesis (TFG).

This repository only holds the finished document for the university, this thesis was the first part of a bigger project that continued after my graduation. The full project is hosted in another repository: [CL-NLP](https://github.com/shernandezg27/CL-NLP).


#### Abstract:
This project aims to study and apply state-of-the-art techniques and tools from the field of natural language processing (NLP) to the identification of related text segments or sentences written in different languages. The main goal to be achieved is taking a first step towards a tool that facilitates the research work in this field, allowing to relate texts, or fragments of them, written in different languages in a fast way.
